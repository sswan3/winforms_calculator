# WinForms Calculator

## Overview
A simple Windows Forms application developed in C# to practice event-driven programming,
object-oriented design, and user input validation.

## Features
- GUI-based calculator supporting basic arithmetic operations
- Separation of UI and calculation logic
- Input validation and error handling
- Clean, modular class structure

## Technologies
- C#
- Windows Forms
- .NET

## Purpose
This project was created as part of coursework to gain hands-on experience with
desktop application development and object-oriented programming principles. Run the main class in your IDE or terminal


Desktop Calculator App | C# & .NET WinForms

A fully functional desktop calculator application built using C# and the Windows Forms (WinForms) framework. This project demonstrates event-driven programming, UI state management, and robust error handling in a .NET environment.

## 🚀 Features
- **Standard Arithmetic:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Defensive Programming:** Prevents application crashes with "Division by Zero" protection and input validation.
- **Clean UI:** Responsive design using the Visual Studio Designer with intuitive button mapping.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** C#
- **Framework:** .NET / WinForms
- **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022 (or 2026)

## 🧠 What I Learned
- **Event Handling:** Mastered the use of Click events and sharing event handlers across multiple buttons to keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- **State Management:** Managed the logic for "First Number," "Operator," and "Second Number" states to ensure calculations follow expected behavior.
- **Parsing & Logic:** Handled string-to-double conversions and floating-point arithmetic precision.
