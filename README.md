# Train Routing System

## Overview
This project is a  application that simulates the management of railcar objects
using custom data structures. It was developed as part of academic coursework to
reinforce core computer science concepts including object-oriented design, pointer
management, and algorithmic logic.

## Features
- Custom implementation of singly and doubly linked lists
- Sorted insertion of elements based on embedded comparison logic
- Robust removal logic that handles edge cases
- Encapsulated, modular class structure

## Technical Concepts Demonstrated
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Data Structures (Linked Lists)
- Algorithmic Problem Solving
- Handling edge cases and stability in logic

## Technology
- Java
- Standard Java libraries

## Project Purpose
This project was created to practice building foundational data structures from
scratch without using language built-in collections. It emphasizes clarity,
correctness, and understanding of underlying mechanisms.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Compile the Java files using `javac`
3. Run the main class in your IDE or terminal
